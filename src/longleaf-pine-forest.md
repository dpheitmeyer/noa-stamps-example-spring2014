Although greatly reduced in size, the longleaf pine forest still occupies parts of its natural range in the coastal plains from southeastern Virginia to eastern Texas. Characterized by the longleaf pine, this unique ecosystem includes many plant communities that vary with soil type, moisture, and frequency of fire.

Before European settlement, fires burned unchecked and the longleaf pine evolved with adaptations to survive fire. Seedlings need fire-cleared ground to become established. They resemble clumps of grass with long needles that protect the buds. Their long taproots store food, allowing the young trees to shoot upward, thus reducing the exposure of the growing tips to fire. Mature trees have thick, protective bark.

This "forest built by fire" still supports diverse species, including the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker. Programs are underway to preserve remaining stands of longleaf and restore them where they have been replaced by other trees.
